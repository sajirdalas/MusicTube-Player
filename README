This is WebApp designed for Firefox OS.

MusicTube Player is a music player which streams audio from youtube. Features

-Type a link to playlist video, playlist page, or playlist id to import the entire playlist.
-Look for youtube videos on the browser or youtube app and import the audio to the player using web activites.
-AlbumArt based on the youtube preview image
-Store and load your custom playlists.

Stuff for developers:

-playlist URLs are processed using YQL to return an array of each "songs" URL
-Every individual URL is processed into an HTML5 audio tag using the youtube.js library extracted from Gaia's native video player
-The Array with the links and the name of the playlists are saved using async storage
-All menus use the action menu as seen here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/UX/Building_blocks/Action_menu/Coding, but with modifications.
